# Perceptron-Sonar-classification
This project implements the perceptron algorithm for the classification of the sonar dataset downloaded from the link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks ). 

the algorithm will calculate the learning errors Ea and generalization errors Eg, Display the N+1 weights W of the perceptron, the stabilities of the P "test" examples according to the gamma formula (distance to the separating hyperplane with the normalized weights).
